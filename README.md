# üìà Stock App

This is a **.NET Core Web API** project that combines **stock market management** with user-driven interaction. Users can track their favorite stocks and equities, create custom portfolios, and participate in discussions via comments‚Äîall within a **secure**, **JWT-authenticated** user system.

## About This Project

This project was developed as part of my journey to deepen my knowledge of **C#** and **.NET Core**. It provides a hands-on learning experience where I'm exploring backend development concepts like building RESTful APIs, implementing **JWT authentication**, and applying clean architecture principles.

I challenged myself by creating a platform that integrates interactive elements and dynamic functionality, drawing inspiration from major live platforms.
